#### City Wide Small Drainage Problem Program

The City of Northglenn has identified the small drainage problems shown here through a series of public comments, staff observations, and routine maintenance activities.  The intent of this map is to provide city staff and ICON engineers a portal to manage the progress of a five-year program to repair and rehabilitate these drainage problems.  

The web map will allow city staff and ICON engineers to monitor progress, discuss issues from a common dataset, and provide an accessible repository for survey, utility, hydrologic, hydraulic, and conceptual design information.

Where a single remedial drainage project can be managed by conventional document management methods – paper, pdf, and email.  A multi-year, multiple element evaluation and design program requires additional resources.  A web based portal to store, monitor, and manage the design and progress of the project can be important to ensure consistency over the years.  At the least, city council leadership will change – having this map available can shorten the re-learning curve for the new council and preserve the momentum of the project.
